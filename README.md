# PortfolioTools

A curated collection of small, focused Python utilities designed for clean structure, predictable behavior, and practical workflow automation. Each tool solves a real‑world problem in a simple, reliable way and produces output that is both human‑friendly and machine‑friendly.

Every tool lives in its own folder with:

- its own README  
- a single, well‑structured Python script  
- consistent naming and design philosophy  

This keeps the suite easy to explore, extend, and integrate into larger systems.

## Included Tools

### 1. Folder Health Check
Analyzes a target directory and produces a structured report including:

- total file count  
- total size  
- largest files  
- extension breakdown  

Useful for audits, cleanup workflows, and automated monitoring.

**Folder:** [folder-health-check](folder-health-check/)

---

### 2. Document Summarizer
Reads a text‑based document and generates a concise, structured summary. Ideal for:

- meeting notes  
- research documents  
- long‑form text you need to understand quickly  

Outputs are formatted for readability and downstream automation.

**Folder:** [document-summarizer](document-summarizer/)

---

### 3. Daily Automation Runner
Runs daily tasks in a predictable sequence. Designed for:

- scheduled maintenance  
- routine checks  
- multi‑step workflows  

The runner is intentionally minimal so it can be extended or integrated into larger systems.

**Folder:** [daily-automation-runner](daily-automation-runner/)

## Design Philosophy

- Clarity over cleverness — readable, predictable code  
- Single‑purpose tools — each folder solves one problem well  
- Modular structure — easy to reuse, extend, or integrate  
- Human‑friendly output — clean formatting for logs and reports  
- Machine‑friendly structure — predictable keys and patterns for automation

## Future Additions

This suite is designed to grow. Planned expansions include:

- additional workflow utilities  
- more automation runners  
- extended reporting formats  
- optional CLI wrappers
