# PortfolioTools

A curated collection of small, focused Python utilities designed for clean structure, predictable behavior, and practical workflow automation. Each tool solves a real‑world problem in a simple, reliable way and produces output that is both human‑friendly and machine‑friendly.

Every tool lives in its own folder with:

- its own README  
- a single, well‑structured Python script  
- consistent naming and design philosophy  

This keeps the suite easy to explore, extend, and integrate into larger systems.

## Included Tools

### 1. Folder Health Check
Analyzes a target directory and produces a structured report including:

### 3. Daily Automation Runner
Runs daily tasks in a predictable sequence. Designed for:

- scheduled maintenance  
- routine checks
