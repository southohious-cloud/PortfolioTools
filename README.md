Portfolio Tools

This collection contains three small, focused utilities designed to demonstrate clean Python design, modular structure, and practical workflow automation. Each tool solves a simple problem in a predictable, reliable way and produces clear, human‑friendly and machine‑friendly output.

The suite is intentionally lightweight and easy to run. Each tool lives in its own folder with its own README and Python script, and all tools follow the same structure and design philosophy.

Included tools

1. Folder Health Check
Analyzes a folder and produces a quick report showing file counts, total size, and the largest files.
Useful for understanding the structure and health of any directory at a glance.

2. Document Summarizer
Reads a text‑based document and generates a clean summary.
Useful for quickly understanding the main ideas of long or dense files.

3. Daily Automation Runner
Performs one automated action per day by taking a daily snapshot of a folder and logging how it changes over time.
Useful for tracking growth, activity, or daily updates in any directory.

Design philosophy

Each tool is built with the same principles:
• 	simple, modular functions
• 	clear docstrings
• 	no comments
• 	predictable input and output
• 	human‑friendly and machine‑friendly logs
• 	no external dependencies
• 	clean folder structure

This keeps the suite easy to understand, easy to extend, and easy to integrate into larger workflows.

Folder structure

Each tool is self‑contained and can be run independently.

How to use the suite
1. 	Open any tool’s folder.
2. 	Read its README for details.
3. 	Run the Python script inside that folder.

No installation steps or configuration files are required.
